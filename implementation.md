This is a crucial strategic step. You are moving from "building the app" to "selling the ecosystem."

Here are detailed suggestions for your **Features** and **About** pages to maximize customer attraction, along with a clear explanation of the **Junk Shop Logistics** to solve your missing link.

### 1. The Missing Link: Junk Shop Logistics (Where does the trash go?)

You asked: *"In case the freelancers get trash... where should they bring it?"*

This is the most powerful part of your business model for Freelancers. You should market this as the **"Double Income" Opportunity**.

**The Workflow:**
1.  **Income #1 (Service Fee):** The Freelancer collects the waste from the resident. The resident pays them the pickup fee (e.g., ₱200) via the app or cash.
2.  **The Split:** The Freelancer checks what they collected.
    * **If it is Recyclable (Bottles, Metal, Carton):** They do **not** throw this away.
    * **If it is Residual/Debris (Tree branches, rubble):** This goes to the **Government Dumpsite**.

**The "Partner Junk Shop" Solution:**
Your app should guide the Freelancer to your **Partner Junk Shops**.
* **The Feature:** "Smart Routing for Profit."
* **How it works:** After a pickup marked as "Recyclable," the app calculates the nearest *Partner Junk Shop* and shows their buying prices (e.g., *"J&J Junkshop is 1km away and buying copper at ₱300/kg"*).
* **Income #2 (Sales):** The Freelancer drives to the partner shop, sells the items, and keeps that money.

**Why this attracts Freelancers:** They get paid *twice* for one job.
**Why this attracts Junk Shops:** They get a steady stream of materials delivered to their door without sending out their own trucks.

### 2. Features Page Add-Ons: "The Full Extent"

To attract customers, stop listing "functions" (e.g., "Map View") and start listing **"Benefits"** (e.g., "Never miss a truck again").

**A. For Residents (The "Convenience" Angle)**
* **"Visual Schedule"**: Don't just say "Notifications." Call it a "Smart Calendar" that highlights *Recyclable Days* vs. *Residual Days* so they never bring out the wrong bag.
* **"Verified Eco-History"**: "Proof that you are a good citizen." Show them that their app history can be used to claim tax incentives or barangay clearances (future government partnership idea).
* **"Hassle-Free Renovation"**: "Renovating your kitchen? Don't let the debris pile up. One tap gets a truck there in 2 hours."

**B. For Freelancers (The "Livelihood" Angle)**
* **"Heatmap Demand"**: "See exactly which barangays have the most pickup requests right now, so you don't drive around empty."
* **"Price Watch"**: "Live updates on junk shop buying prices. Know exactly where to sell your load for the highest profit."
* **"Digital ID Badge"**: "Gain trust instantly. Your profile in the app acts as a verified ID, so homeowners feel safe letting you enter their gates."

**C. For Junk Shop Partners (The "Supply Chain" Angle)**
* **"Incoming Supply Alert"**: "Get notified *before* the trash arrives. 'Driver John is incoming with 50kg of cardboard.' Prepare your cash and space."
* **"Verified Source"**: "No more stolen cables or questionable scrap. All items come from verified residential pickups recorded on the app."

### 3. About Page Add-Ons: "The Reason Why"

Your About page needs to connect emotionally. It shouldn't just be "We are a tech company." It should be "We are solving a crisis."

**A. The "Why": The Silent Crisis**
* **The Hook:** "Dumaguete is growing, and so is our waste."
* **The Problem:** Explain that traditional government collection is overwhelmed. Trucks break down, schedules drift, and people resort to burning trash (illegal) or dumping in rivers because they miss the truck.
* **The Solution:** "E-Konek isn't just an app; it's a digital bridge. We don't replace the government; we give them 'eyes' on the ground. We don't replace junk shops; we become their logistics arm."

**B. The "Circular Economy" Mission**
* **Explain the Vision:** "We believe trash is only 'waste' if you mix it. If you separate it, it's a 'resource'."
* **The Goal:** "Our goal is to divert 50% of Dumaguete's waste *away* from the Candau-ay Dumpsite and *into* recycling centers, extending the lifespan of our city's landfill."

**C. The "Community First" Promise**
* **For the "Wife's Role" (Operations):** Highlight that there is a real human talking to the tricycle drivers and junk shop owners, vetting them personally to ensure safety.
* **Local Pride:** Emphasize that this is *Made in Dumaguete, for Dumaguete*. It understands the local culture of "Purok" systems and "Bayanihan."

**D. Transparency Section**
* **Where the money goes:** Explicitly state: "When you pay for a special pickup, 80% goes directly to the local driver. You are feeding a family, not a corporation."

### Summary of Actionable Changes

1.  **Update your App Logic:** Ensure the `GigView` explicitly guides Freelancers to **Partner Junk Shops** for recyclables and **Official Dumpsites** for residuals.
2.  **Marketing Copy:** Rewrite your Features page to focus on *income* for workers and *convenience* for residents.
3.  **Storytelling:** Reframe your About page from "We built an app" to "We are fixing the supply chain of waste to save our city."
